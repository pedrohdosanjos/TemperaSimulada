# Simulated Annealing - Knapsack Problem

**Academic project implementing the Simulated Annealing technique to solve the combinatorial Knapsack Problem.**

Developed for the Intelligent Systems course â€” Computer Engineering | UTFPR.

This program uses a modular C++ implementation with classes to represent items and item lists. The goal is to select items based on their value and weight while respecting the maximum capacity of the knapsack, and to find an optimized solution using Simulated Annealing.

---

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., g++)
- **Operating System** compatible with C++ binaries (Linux, Windows, etc.)

---

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run the program, use the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
g++ -o temperaSimulada ./temperaSimulada.cpp ./sources/item.cpp ./sources/listaItens.cpp ./sources/DataHandler.cpp

./temperaSimulada
```

## Notes

- This project was developed as part of an academic assignment.
- The algorithm is implemented with simplicity and clarity in mind, focusing on functionality.
